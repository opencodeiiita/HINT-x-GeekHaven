When you redesign, redesign Big! Time to redesign the HINT website. 
Yes, the Hack in the North official website, hosted at [https://www.hackinthenorth.com/](https://www.hackinthenorth.com/). Why disturb its peaceful existence? The motives behind this should be of no concern to you, the only thing that matters is that it is a 50 Point task. Yes, you heard it right, a 50 Pointer! Not to mention the fact, the judging will be like a 50 points task too. Don't think that the PRs will be easily merged, do try your best though, you have 10 days' time.

The trick is don't be a wimp while redesigning the website ( and in life too ðŸ™‚). Don't be afraid to change the color theme, completely change its face, and give the website a new look.

The only thing is design principles should be followed, it should look good, the website must have consistency, etc. We will see how it goes ðŸ˜‡

For getting an idea about the theme, consider the following websites
[https://linear.app/](https://linear.app/)
[https://www.circle.com/en/](https://www.circle.com/en/)
[https://cosmos.network/](https://cosmos.network/)
[https://www.blocknative.com/ ](https://www.blocknative.com/ )
OR any modern looking that you found on the internet and can be modified into a hackathon website.

Create the redesigned website in a Figma file and export it as png. Create PR by submitting the PNG and the Figma file link in the HINT website Redesign folder
